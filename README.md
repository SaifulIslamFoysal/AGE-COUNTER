The HealthAge app is designed to calculate a user's full age based on their birthday. It offers precise age breakdowns, input validation, and special features for various scenarios:

Calculate Full Age (Years, Months, Days):

The app calculates a user’s complete age in terms of years, months, and days based on their selected birthday.
Handles Single Year:

If the user is exactly one year old, it displays “1 year” instead of “years” for clarity and precision.
Handles Age Less Than 1 Year:

For users under a year old, the app displays the age in months and days, e.g., “You are 5 months 2 days old.”
Handles Age Less Than 1 Month:

If the user is under a month old, the app shows their age only in days, e.g., “You are 10 days old.”
Checks for Negative Age (Future Birthdays):

If a future birthday is selected, the app alerts the user with “Invalid age! You are not born yet.”
Wishes Happy Birthday:

If today is the user’s birthday, the app surprises them with a birthday message: “Happy Birthday! You are X years now!”
Handles Input Validation:

When no birthday is selected, the app prompts the user with “Input your birthday.”
